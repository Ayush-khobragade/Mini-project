snake game :
The Snake Game is a classic arcade-style game where the player controls a snake that moves around the screen, eating food to grow longer while avoiding collisions with the screen edges and itself. The objective is to score as many points as possible by consuming the food items and achieving the longest length possible before the game ends.

Gameplay:

Controls:
Arrow Keys: Move the snake in the corresponding direction (Left, Right, Up, Down).

Guide the snake to consume the black circular food items that appear on the screen.
Each time the snake eats food, it grows in length, and the player’s score increases.
End of Game:
The game ends if the snake collides with the edges of the screen or itself.
Upon losing, the player can choose to quit or restart the game from the game over screen.
